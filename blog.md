I've been following [this guy's tutorial](https://cadiboo.github.io/tutorials/1.15.2/forge/) on how to mod with Forge 1.15.2, which has worked great with 1.16.1, no compatibility issues I can see. The problem is his tutorial ran out just after teaching how to create a block &ndash; the remaining steps are in what I suspect to be a permanent WIP state.

I'm hung up on how to create a BlockItem. The BlockItem class is what associates the *block* in the world with the *item* in the inventory. Specifically, I have to reference my example_ore block (Block object) somehow in the creation of the example_oreitem (BlockItem object). There's a spot in the creation of a BlockItem to reference a Block object. I just don't know how to reference it. Rather, I don't know what the best practice is to reference it &ndash; I could probably hack something together, but without understanding what I'm doing I wouldn't want to fuck something up. That's why I was really happy to have this cadiboo guy who seemed to really understand how to code well *and* apply it in the Forge environment *AND* give pretty good overviews of the coding concepts he was employing.

Though I do feel like I should maybe just try shit out, instead of scouring the internet for a similar tutorial. Especially cuz each tutorial seems to teach you to do things a little bit differently (hell, even cadiboo's example mod code was different than the way he coded in the tutorial), I definitely don't understand my code enough to know *how* it's different than other people's approaches. Only that it is.

Anyway. It seems the only class to update when adding new items is `ModEventSubscriber`. The second example item went into the ItemGroup without any modifications to `ModItems` or `ModItemGroups`. Also the [Forge documentation](https://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blocks/blocks/) states that Blocks don't get assigned groups, only BlockItems. So I don't know exactly how the `ModBlocks` class is going to fit in if blocks aren't referenced in `ModItemGroups` the way items are. Maybe `ModBlocks` isn't needed? These are the things I need to figure out before I try to reference a BlockItem's Block.
